# GLADIA - Light Sculpture Toolkit

## Overview

GLADIA is a comprehensive collection of command-line tools designed for audiovisual exploration, analysis, and creation. Inspired by the concept of "sculpting light and sound," these tools enable you to generate, transform, and combine audiovisual materials directly from the command line.

## Core Philosophy

The toolkit operates on the principle of Unix-like simplicity: each tool does one thing well, but their true power emerges when combined. Output from one tool naturally flows into another, creating a sculptural approach to media manipulation where raw audiovisual material can be progressively refined, transformed, and recombined.

The system combines automatic processes with manual control, offering creators a free and experimental environment. The goal is to provide a toolkit that enables you to construct works, analyze materials, or experiment with sound, image, and movement.

## Domain & Capabilities

GLADIA specializes in the audiovisual spectrum, offering capabilities across:

- **Video Processing**: Download, trim, split, loop, compress, translate
- **Audio Engineering**: Layer separation, voice cloning, frequency generation, mastering
- **Image Manipulation**: Generation, enhancement, description, motion effects
- **Analysis Tools**: Musical analysis, video compatibility checking, spectral visualization
- **Synthesis**: Voice synthesis from text, frequency generation, audio modulation

## Architecture

Each script is self-contained and portable, automatically managing its own dependencies on first run. The toolkit uses a consistent directory structure under `$HOME/light-sculpture/` for outputs, maintaining clean separation between different operation types while facilitating easy pipeline construction.

## Installation & Usage

Simply clone the repository and run any script - each will handle its own setup on first execution. No complex installation procedures, no dependency hell - just immediate functionality that grows more powerful as you explore the connections between tools.
